The architecture consists of four layers: the data layer, the repository layer, the business logic layer, and the presentation layer. Each layer has a single responsibility and there are clear boundaries between each one. We’ve discovered that a layered architecture significantly enhances the developer experience. Each layer can be developed independently by different teams without impacting other layers. Testing is simplified since only one layer needs to be mocked. Additionally, a structured approach clarifies component ownership, streamlining development and code reviews."
